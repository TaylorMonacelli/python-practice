MS Windows

For MS Windows, recent lxml releases feature community donated binary
distributions, although you might still want to take a look at the
related FAQ entry. If you fail to build lxml on your MS Windows system
from the signed and tested sources that we release, consider using the
binary builds from PyPI or the unofficial Windows binaries that
Christoph Gohlke generously provides.
