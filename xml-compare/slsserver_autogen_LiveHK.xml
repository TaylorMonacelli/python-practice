* aws_s3_secret -

* tnc_server - http://54.245.163.78:1926.  Transcap Node server.  Only
appies to Live Server, not Enterprise Server.

* tc_create_wait_sec - default 600.  Wait this many seconds for Transcap
node.  Only applies to Live Server, not Enterprise Server.

* purge_file_on_delete - boolean (0=false/1).  When you delete a media
file using the web interface, if purge_file_on_delete="1" then the file
will immediately be deleted from the filesystem.  Otherwise, if
purge_file_on_delete="0", then the file will be marked for deletion and
removed from the filesystem during cron job cleanup.

* debug_create_size - 1000 - debug value to simulate creating archive
files. Only used for developer debugging purpose.

* ffmpeg_path - depreciated variable.  No longer used.
c:\SLS_DB\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg

* required_ver_ls_php

* email_template_path - default: includes/email_templates

* bc_username - BigCommerce Store Username

* bc_store_url - default https://store.streambox.com - BigCommerce Store
url

* bc_api_key - BigCommerce Store API Key

* date_format

* email_from - string (e.g. sbxes1@gmail.com).  Email sent to users of
enterprise server/live server will receive email from sbxes1@gmail.com
if email_from=sbxes1@gmail.com for example.  email_from is a field in
streambox_live.slsconfig database table, but its overridden by the setting
in this file if email_from is not blank.

* store_url

* lsbin_timeout - how long (in seconds) to wait for binary to response
before giving up. This is to eliminate the long wait when binary is
somehow not responding.  Example lsbin_timeout="3"

* site_name

* timezone

* smtp_host - ES/Live can email you your password if you forget it.  So
if you configure (smtp_login, smtp_host, smtp_pass and smtp_port), and
you logout of ES/Live and at the login page, you click the forgot
password link, then, will email be sent to your through this smtp_host.

* smtp_login - see description in smtp_host.

* smtp_pass - see description in smtp_host.

* smtp_port - see description in smtp_host.

* email_to_override -

* email_to_accounting -

* email_to_support -

* activity_log_display - default=50, maximum number of record to display
on system log page

* ports - in the below <ports> stanza must be listed in ascending
order!!!  (ie 1770 comes before 1780, etc. or else you will not see
incoming streams in the Live tab of the web ui.)

* server_domain_name - We're adding server_domain_name and server_ip to
here because when localdb fails, then we can't use backup database
server_doamin_name and _ip because mulitple machines use that db.
Example: server_domain_name ="127.0.0.1"

* server_ip - We're adding server_domain_name and server_ip to here
because when localdb fails, then we can't use backup database
server_doamin_name and _ip because mulitple machines use that db.
Example: server_ip="127.0.0.1"

* mysql_backup_host - either null or hostname.  Example:
mysql_backup_host="livedb.streambox.com".  mysql_backup_host="" means
use mysql.default_host in php.ini.

* mysql_use_backup - boolean, 0 means use default database (see
mysql.default_host in php.ini), 1 means use backup database.  Example:
mysql_use_backup="0"

* mysql_backup_pass - mysql password for sls_php on
livedb.streambox.com.  If mysql_backup_host is empty, then
mysql_use_backup and mysql_backup_pass are irrelevant.

If mysql_backup_pass is wrong, then when server goes into backup mode
and sysadmin will be locked out completely.

If this happens, then the only option is to modify slsserver.xml, then
fix the password and restart apache service.

* actl3trans - absolute path to the ACT-L3 transcoder.exe.  Example:
actl3trans="c:\SLS_DB\actl3trans\transcoder.exe"

* act_port - for cases where sls.exe and mobile devices can't activate
with activation server over port TCP/80, you can set act_port to use a
different port other than 80.  If act_port is not defined in <storage/>
element, then activatin will go over TCP/80 by default.

We've seen cases where although $ telnet {activation server IP} 80 seems
to succeed, still sls.exe can't communicate properly with activation
server as though something is mangling the TCP/80 connection.  Example:
act_port="85" Here sls.exe would try to activate using TCP port 85.

* archive - If this boolean is "yes" then store ACT-L3 streams to the
folder specified by the 'path' parameter.  If no, dont store.  Example:
archive="yes"

* convert_amt - The overall maximum number of trascoders allowed to run
simultaneously.  By transcoders here we mean not just Streambox
transcoder.exe, but all the others including (mencoder.exe, mplayer.exe,
ffmpeg.exe, transcoder.exe, others?).

* data_drive - The data partition.  Example data_drive="d:" or
data_drive="e:", etc.  This might be the OS partition if there is no
data partition available, but ideally we want to store ever growing log
files and media files on the data partition.

This parameter should be set at install time either by installer or
manually.

* flash_amount - limit the number of simultaneous processes that can
create flash files.  Example: flash_amount="10"

* flash_max - Example: flash_max="600"

* frames - The maximum number of frames to generate for Flash.  Example:
frames="1000"

* frames_thumb - The number of images that mplayer should create from
the quicktime mov file.  Range [1,frames] (see the frames parameter).
If frames_thumb is greater than frames, then sls.exe will cut the MOV
off at the same value of frames, therefore frames_thumb range is
[1,frames].  Example frames_thumb="50"

* limiter - The maximum number of instances sls.exe allows of the
Streambox transcoder.exe process to run simultaneously.  If limiter is
not listed in this config, then default value is 2.

* meta - yes/no.  Default value is meta="yes" if its not specified.
meta="no" means sls.exe doesn't wait for a metadata packet. It registers
stream immediately after any packet comes.

It's a workaround that helps very old encoders to be processed as soon
as possible.

* nopic - The image to display before the thumbnail has been created by
mplayer.  This file must exist in the web $docroot/ls directory.
Example: nopic="nopic2.jpg"

* path - The absolute path to store Streambox media files.  'webpath'
and 'path' are the same values now, so you should set 'path' equal to
the same value as 'webpath'.  This is legacy.  Originally 'webpath' and
'path' meant something different, but now they're the same.  Example:
path="c:\Apache\htdocs\ls\actl3files"

* preview - Example: preview="c:\SLS_DB\wrappers\mcwrap_mov_flv.cmd"

* thumb - The comandline used to generate frames for the thumbnail.
Example: thumb="C:\SLS_DB\wrappers\extract_frame.cmd
&quot;C:\SLS_DB\wrappers&quot;"

* thumb_amount - limit the number of simultaneous process to create
thumbnails.  Example: thumb_amount="20"

* thumb_max - The maximum number of seconds to allow the thumbnail to be
created.  The purpose of this is to prevent mplayer hanging from
stopping the thumbnial generation workflow.  So, for example, if mplayer
hangs for longer than thumb_max seconds, then sls.exe will kill off the
mplayer process.  Example: thumb_max="300"

* webpath - The absolute path to store Streambox media files.  'webpath'
and 'path' are the same values now, so you should set path equal to the
same value as webpath.  This is legacy.  Originally 'webpath' and 'path'
meant something different, but now they're the same.  Example:
webpath="c:\Apache\htdocs\ls\actl3files"
