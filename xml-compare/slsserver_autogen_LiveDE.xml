* ports in the below <ports> stanza must be listed in ascending order!!!
  (ie 1770 comes before 1780, etc. or else you will not see incoming
  streams in the Live tab of the web ui.)

* server_domain_name - We're adding server_domain_name and server_ip to
  here because when localdb fails, then we can't use backup database
  server_doamin_name and _ip because mulitple machines use that db.
  Example: server_domain_name ="127.0.0.1"

* server_ip - We're adding server_domain_name and server_ip to here
  because when localdb fails, then we can't use backup database
  server_doamin_name and _ip because mulitple machines use that db.
  Example: server_ip="127.0.0.1"

* mysql_backup_host - either null or hostname.  Example:
  mysql_backup_host="livedb.streambox.com".  mysql_backup_host="" means
  use mysql.default_host in php.ini.

* mysql_use_backup - boolean, 0 means use default database (see
  mysql.default_host in php.ini), 1 means use backup database.  Example:
  mysql_use_backup="0"

* mysql_backup_pass - mysql password for sls_php on
  livedb.streambox.com.  If mysql_backup_host is empty, then
  mysql_use_backup and mysql_backup_pass are irrelevant.

  If mysql_backup_pass is wrong, then when server goes into backup mode
  and sysadmin will be locked out completely.

  If this happens, then the only option is to modify slsserver.xml, then
  fix the password and restart apache service.

* actl3trans - absolute path to the ACT-L3 transcoder.exe.  Example:
  actl3trans="c:\SLS_DB\actl3trans\transcoder.exe"

* act_port - for cases where sls.exe and mobile devices can't activate
  with activation server over port TCP/80, you can set act_port to use a
  different port other than 80.  If act_port is not defined in
  <storage/> element, then activatin will go over TCP/80 by default.

  We've seen cases where although $ telnet {activation server IP} 80
  seems to succeed, still sls.exe can't communicate properly with
  activation server as though something is mangling the TCP/80
  connection.  Example: act_port="85" Here sls.exe would try to activate
  using TCP port 85.

* archive - If this boolean is "yes" then store ACT-L3 streams to the
  folder specified by the 'path' parameter.  If no, dont store.
  Example: archive="yes"

* convert_amt - The overall maximum number of trascoders allowed to run
  simultaneously.  By transcoders here we mean not just Streambox
  transcoder.exe, but all the others including (mencoder.exe,
  mplayer.exe, ffmpeg.exe, transcoder.exe, others?).

* flash_amount - limit the number of simultaneous processes that can
  create flash files.  Example: flash_amount="10"

* flash_max - Example: flash_max="600"

* frames - The maximum number of frames to generate for Flash.  Example:
  frames="1000"

* frames_thumb - The number of images that mplayer should create from
  the quicktime mov file.  Range [1,frames] (see the frames parameter).
  If frames_thumb is greater than frames, then sls.exe will cut the MOV
  off at the same value of frames, therefore frames_thumb range is
  [1,frames].  Example frames_thumb="50"

* limiter - The maximum number of instances sls.exe allows of the
  Streambox transcoder.exe process to run simultaneously.  If limiter is
  not listed in this config, then default value is 2.

* meta - yes/no.  Default value is meta="yes" if its not specified.
  meta="no" means sls.exe doesn't wait for a metadata packet. It
  registers stream immediately after any packet comes.

  It's a workaround that helps very old encoders to be processed as soon
  as possible.

* nopic - The image to display before the thumbnail has been created by
  mplayer.  This file must exist in the web $docroot/ls directory.
  Example: nopic="nopic2.jpg"

* path - The absolute path to store Streambox media files.  'webpath'
  and 'path' are the same values now, so you should set 'path' equal to
  the same value as 'webpath'.  This is legacy.  Originally 'webpath'
  and 'path' meant something different, but now they're the same.
  Example: path="c:\Apache\htdocs\ls\actl3files"

* preview - Example: preview="c:\SLS_DB\wrappers\mcwrap_mov_flv.cmd"

* thumb - The comandline used to generate frames for the thumbnail.
  Example: thumb="C:\SLS_DB\wrappers\extract_frame.cmd
  &quot;C:\SLS_DB\wrappers&quot;"

* thumb_amount - limit the number of simultaneous process to create
  thumbnails.  Example: thumb_amount="20"

* thumb_max - The maximum number of seconds to allow the thumbnail to be
  created.  The purpose of this is to prevent mplayer hanging from
  stopping the thumbnial generation workflow.  So, for example, if
  mplayer hangs for longer than thumb_max seconds, then sls.exe will
  kill off the mplayer process.  Example: thumb_max="300"

* webpath - The absolute path to store Streambox media files.  'webpath'
  and 'path' are the same values now, so you should set path equal to
  the same value as webpath.  This is legacy.  Originally 'webpath' and
  'path' meant something different, but now they're the same.  Example:
  webpath="c:\Apache\htdocs\ls\actl3files"
